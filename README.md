# Traditional-Computer-Vision

<B>Computer Vision(CV)</B> is one of the de facto Artificial Intelligence technology that is present in many AI applications we come across.

<I>"Process of discovering from images what is present in the world, where it is, and what it is doing!"</I>

The use of computer vision techniques is prevalent in a wide variety of applications, including facial recognition, self-driving cars, augmented reality, and many others.

Traditional computer vision involves an in-depth analysis of the input and output. The in-depth analysis reveal what mathematically representable features can be extracted from an image and coupled with an efficient algorithm to produce the desired result.

I have implemented the following techniques in Python using Traditional CV techniques:
<ol>1. Basics of Image Processing</ol>
<ol>2. Smoothening and Edge Detection</ol> 
<ol>3. Similitude Momentsg</ol>
<ol>4. MHI and MEI</ol> 
<ol>5. Motion Tracking</ol>
<ol>6. Superpixel and NCC</ol> 
<ol>7. Feature extraction and Interest Point detection</ol>
<ol>8. 2D to 3D Projection Calculation</ol> 
<ol>9. Template Matching and KNN</ol>
